# CLIP-Flow: A Unified Model for Image Understanding and Generation

CLIP-Flow is a unified multimodal foundation model that combines autoregressive large language models with diffusion-based generation techniques. Unlike existing approaches that diffuse VAE features, CLIP-Flow leverages CLIP image features as the diffusion target, enabling both efficient generation and strong performance across understanding and generation tasks. This repository contains the code, models, and experiments presented in our research paper.

## Overview

CLIP-Flow bridges the gap between vision understanding and generation by:

- Unifying the modeling of images and text under a single architecture.
- Diffusing semantically meaningful CLIP features rather than raw pixels or VAE latents.
- Demonstrating competitive performance in both zero-shot image understanding and high-quality image generation.

## üîç Image Understanding Performance

CLIP-Flow achieves strong performance on standard benchmarks for image understanding. The model is evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings, demonstrating competitive accuracy with significantly fewer parameters than traditional vision-language models.
